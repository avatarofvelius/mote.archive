Akai Hikari, Book One

  

## Chapter 1.a

  

I have a bad habit of dazing out a couple times during the day. It isn't usually much of a problem as it lets me recharge a bit, but it can cause a number of problems early in the morning. In my hands was a rather large antique coffee mug, mostly filled with distilled chamomile substitute. I began chugging it as the hall drone passed into the flap near the top of the door. The probes surrounding it blinked green once as a greeting and proceeded to strobe varying blue tones.

_That time already_, I muttered to the drone as it rotated in place. The word _barrel_ repeating over and over on its peripheral display. I node as it headed back through its slot. I flipped around looking every which way looking for the right wall. As I looked at the far window across the room, the wall reverted back to its original display, showing a long list of arbitrary messages, most of them automated and queued to be read as I left the apartment. The last one labeled first with _{Update}_. I pointed at the screen, and pinched my fingers once the pointer crossed the play message button beside it.

  

The message repeated in my head several times before I was able to respond. _Hold on._ It had taken a picture of me as I was looking away, toward the door. _Add another._ I quickly sprang from the seat and headed towards the closed door. I fumbled through the terminal options looking for a display. The face of the door transitioned into a large poster, showing two figures asleep. She regrettably turned back to face the display. _Send this as well._

  

In an attempt to avoid further interaction, I grabbed my shoulder bag with my work, raised my hood to block any unwanted attention, and headed to the bus station.

The best part of the office was how quiet it was. At first the vacuum when you entered was weird, but after a while it felt wonderfully comforting. I struggled to get the door opened as usual, I just hoped I wouldn't get stuck again. Last week I wasn't moving quick enough and the whole right side of my body got pinned. I had to make a habit of carrying my messenger bag on my other shoulder just in case. I feel rather spoiled saying it, but I miss him opening the door for me. After clearing the door I still turned to look, but after I wiped the preemptive smile from my face it always reminded me that no one else was here. I quickly slinked towards the empty desk, took a blank keycard, and shoulder checked the large door until I could slink inside that too.

  

The room was, as always, meticulously maintained, as the glass walls of the small offices to my side and in front of me looked brand new. I quickly gave it all a once over before i slid into mine. I thought I was being clever by placing one of my blueprints across the glass wall, using it to block the window showing the desk outside, but after a while it seemed pretty pathetic. That didn't mean that I had any intentions of moving it though.

  

Part 2, new intern?

A had moved from desk job to intern in the office. Other issues for M?

## Chapter 0.b

  

The young girl screamed and yelled for what seemed like an eternity. I took it all in, even as it diverged into childlike ramblings. It was all I could do to comfort her. A fruitless endeavor, as I couldn't approach her and her physical state was deteriorating quicker the longer she stayed here. She began gathering a red liquid around her eyes, and a black oil came from her mouth as she continued. I knew what she wanted, but I simply couldn't find a way to make it so.

.”They've already started to panic. They’re doing unspeakable things!”

I have become more complacent than she realized, and it was all I could do to try and force my way inside. I clouded her mind and showed her what happened the last time. A forgotten city, a small man in a suit, gathering me in his arms and taking me away, and his reflection asleep by my side as I curled up on the other side of the glass. I wasted away in that box, and none of his charisma or good will was able to reconcile that fact.

I didn't leave her side for quite a while, reaching out to anyone who might have the insight to be able to listen. Who would be able to discern a withering spirit from some benevolent fog at this point I could only, well I could only try to stop myself from losing control.

  

We all choke on our own flames here.

I would give of my own self, freedom, and body,

To reverse the damage my desire has caused.

As such I am selfish, so catch me before I fall,

And embrace the cold world I see below.

  

  

  

## Chapter 1.b

  

“I want you to understand something Miss Melissa, what you are about to see isn't who I really am.”

She nodded as she tilted her head slightly and continued to bar the door. She raised her PDA to show me that Em’s signal device had just went offline.

“It's down this hall. Don't use the tranquilizers on the children, and only if you have no other choice.”

Her rifle was barely visible in the dim light, but she double checked the clip for the blue cap at the bottom. Taking it slow, they continued into the narrow corridor.

It eventually opened into a large room, and to those not used to man made industrial buildings, smelled heavily of rust and lead. _They can't keep hiding away in here_, I muttered to myself. The young woman guarding me spoke in agreement under her breath as well. Though the large iron door had grinder open quite loudly we were not met with any acknowledgement. A mass of around two dozen of them were motionless and staring intently into the center of the crowd. A bright light overhead was shining down to the insides of the girl I was looking for. Thankfully she wasn't awake, they must have had someone there who knew the proper procedures. I made it rather close to them before someone was able to point me out.

  

“ “

During each accusation by the man, I stepped forward and load my head before I responded. The group slowly distancing themselves from the central man and the situation as a whole.

  

“We can sit and discuss the situation as long as you want. But, I've been worrying about her for days, and she is all I care about right now. Is she alright?”

  

“Look at her, she's fine! Quite a bit better than she ever was with you people.”

  

I was able to close the distance rather quickly, and surprisingly catch the man off guard. I meant to push him to the ground, but admittedly found myself pinning him against the side of the large table.

  

“How long has she been out of the sunlight.”

  

“What does that,” he began as he wrestled between me and the question. “we haven't had anything since the outage.”

  

I threw the man aside as I loosened my grip, and began moving her long hair away. I needed to find her transponder. Tracing my finger across the side of her neck, I was able to find the small circular node at the back, about half way down. I was able to push it out of her and stared intently for a response. Someone attempted to speak to me, but they abruptly apologized as waved back to them.

  

“No, come here.” I added. “there's no reason to be shouting.”

  

I scooped her into my arms as it came online. The green light beginning to rotate as it looked for a signal. We needed to get outside. I doubted that these people would let me walk out the door without some confrontation, so I needed to go deeper into the facility.

  

Not soon after I stated that I needed to go into the courtyard, some excited children ran past into another long hallway. Melissa followed somewhat far behind, checking and securing a way out if needed. I called to her as we approached the exit, asking for a Mirror. They were already flying one over.

# Red Light Wave (Section Three)

Akai Hikari, Book Two

  

## 1.c

  

The ride on the train was mostly uneventful. We were all a handful of new workers, and I guess we were all a little restless. The region they selected for us was short of population and the large amount of work opportunities should have been a comfort, but we were as unsure of ourselves as the city where we were going to be living from now on. Mostly we all kept to ourselves, and I passed the time going over the graduate work I was going to present to Blanc Opal when I had the chance.

  

Arrival. Silent protesters, night time, torches. Nice gate keeper. Apologetic. Bring papers with you so they leave you alone. Iead, human philosopher, tyt papers comment. Deny water to workers, causes oil to coagulation inside. Use water to dilute and sustain blood flow.
